When the ambassadors oi the Bituriges came ¹to ask ior

aid, the Haedui sent forces oi cavalry and infantry ²to ·

their assistance3 but when these had come to the river
Loire, they did not crosa, but returned home again and
8made the following report: “We have returned because
we ieared treachery; for we knew that, it we crossed the
river, the Bituriges ⁴wonld su'rround us on one side and
the Arverni on the other, that they might the more easily
destroy us.'' It is not clear whether we ought to regard⁶
this as the truth or not. When these matters were reported
to Caesar, he was in great difficulty how to reach his army,
ior at that time he did not dare to intrust his safety even
to those who seemed⁶ peaceable.
