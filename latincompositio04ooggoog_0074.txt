The inhabitants oi Noviodunum had sent ambassadors
to Caesar lto beg that he spare their lives,² and he had
already demanded hostages and had sent some centurions
and soldiers into the town to search for weapons‚ when the
cavalry oi Vercingetorix was seen in the distance. The
Gauls in the town, as soon as they beheld this, raising a
shout‚ seized8 their arms, closed⁸ the gateS, and manned³
the wall. Caesar without delay⁴ led forth his German
horsemen, whom he had had with him for many years, and
easily put the enemy to ssight, some being' lost and others
retreating to Vercingetorix. Thereupon⁵ the townspeople
surrendered a second time, and a few hours later⁶ Caesar
was on his way to Avaricum, which was at that time the
largest town ol the Bituriges.
