magistrates are chosen to take charge of the war. Many
iorays are made against neighboring tribes t0 train the
youth, and 2whenever any one of the chieis says in the
council that he will be the leader of a foray, those who rise
³to follow him are greatly praised. ²Whoever come to them
for whatever reason, they protect from injury, since they
do not think it right to harm a guest. Though the Gauls
formerly excelled the Germans in ⁴ivarlil<e renown, they
have gradually become accustomed to being conquered,

and ⁵at this time do not even compare themselves with
the Germans in valor.
