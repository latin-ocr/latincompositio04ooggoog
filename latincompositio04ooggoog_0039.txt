The ships of the Veneti were well fitted ¹to withstand
the waves and tempests ol the ocean. They were made
entirely ol oak and had skins for sails, ²so that they might
endure the violence oi the winds more easily. ³Thus it
followed that our ships excelled only in speed and rowing‚⁴
but that theirs⁵ were better adapted to the character of
the place. An added lact was that on account oi their
great strength 6they could not⁷ be injured by ramming
nor⁷ did they lear the rocks and the shallows which were
an ⁸object of lear to us. ,
