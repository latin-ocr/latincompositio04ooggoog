' Caesar says that at Avaricum something happened before
his eyes that seemed to him worthy of mention. A certain
Gaul, who was throwing balls of tallow on the lire, was
pierced through and killed by a scarpra. Without any¹
delay one of the hystanders‚² disregarding8 the extreme
peril, performed the duty, and the second being killed in
the same way, a third took his place and a fourth (the
place of) the third. After they had tried everything in

¹ vain,⁴ the Gauls made preparations to escape from the city

by night; but the women, ⁵hearing this, suddenly rushed
into the streets⁶ and begged them to spare⁷ their lives,
8and not surrender to the foe those whom weakness pre·
vented from taking flight.
