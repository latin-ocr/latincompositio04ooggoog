When Caesar heard that Vercingetorix and his cavalry
had set out 1ἰοῐ the place where he thought our men would
come the next day to get fodder, he himself with part of his
own² troops set out at midnight for the camp ol the enemy.
The Gauls were holding a hill which was surrounded on all
sides by a swamp about8 fifty feet* wide, and were ready

to overwhelm the Romans if any of them should attempt
to break through the fords. Caesar quickly saw the
inequality of the conditions, and showed his soldiers, wh0,
eager⁵ for victory, were demanding the signal for battle,
⁶how much the victory would necessarily cost3 and the
same day led them back into camp. It was (characteristic)
ot Caesar to hold the lives⁷ of his men dearer than his
own² glory.
