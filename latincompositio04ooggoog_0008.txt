graded in point ol difficulty and are lor both oral and
’ written work.

Exnncrses ron Onne Tnnusenrrou. Three exercises
for oral translation precede each one for written work.
The sentences have been made as simple as possible, and,
while using the vocabulary and idioms of the text, aim to
exemplily the principles of syntax set forth in the accom-

panying grammar lessons. These principles are in every
case still further exemplified in the exercises that immedi-
ately follow. The largest space has been given to the
constructions that are the most important, such as the
subjunctive in Final and in Consecutive Clauses, Condi·
tional sentences, Indirect Discourse, etc. A few lessons
involving some oi the more difficult or more unusual con·
structions have been marked with an asterisk,·and may be
omitted at the discretion ol the teacher. The work in
oral prose may be done most easily and profitably in con-
nection with each day's review lesson.

Exoremus ron Wrurreu Tenusnnrrorv. The exercises
for written translation are in connected English narrative
and aim to reviewvespecially the grammatical principles
treated in the three preceding oral exercises, and to give
practice in writing connected Latin. They will not be
found too difficult alter a carelul study ol the text.

A Gnnmmnrrcne Iunex has been added for convenience
ol reference.
